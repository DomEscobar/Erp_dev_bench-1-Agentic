# 🏗 EmpoweredPixels Agentic (V1.0)

This repository follows the **Universal Agentic Project Structure**. It is designed for maximum alignment between autonomous agents and human developers.

## 🚀 Setup for Agents
1.  **Read the Anchor**: `ai_instructions.md` is your first stop.
2.  **Declare Intent**: Update `.agent_state/current_task.md` before coding.
3.  **Respect the Soul**: Check `agents.md` to ensure your current role matches the task.

## 📁 Key Folders
-   **`.ai/`**: Static knowledge center (Architecture, Standards).
-   **`.agent_state/`**: Dynamic working memory (Current task, History).
-   **`shared/`**: The "Contract" between frontend and backend.

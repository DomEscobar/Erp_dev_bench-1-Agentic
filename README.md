# 🏗 EmpoweredPixels: Agentic Benchmarking & ERP Prototype

Welcome to the **EmpoweredPixels** core development repository. This branch serves as the "Agentic Forge" where we test the boundaries of autonomous software engineering using the Agency Governance model.

## 📖 The Vision
EmpoweredPixels is a fully autonomous game studio project. This specific repository is an **ERP & Logic Benchmark** used to validate our agent roster's ability to build complex, multi-layered business logic (Hierarchical categories, search, auth) with zero human intervention.

## 🏛 Governance Model (Agency V12.2)
This project is governed by a **Physical Desk Architecture**. We do not use single-bot prompts; we use a roster of specialized personas:
- **Architect**: Designs the specs.
- **Hammer**: Builds the code.
- **Skeptic**: Audits for security and logic.
- **Medic**: Self-heals build errors.

## 🛠 Project Structure (Universal Alignment)
To allow agents to operate safely, we use a specialized markdown-driven alignment structure:
- `ai_instructions.md`: The "Anchor" for all AI agents.
- `.ai/`: Static architectural decisions and coding standards.
- `.agent_state/`: Live working memory and telemetry of active tasks.
- `shared/`: The type-safe contract between Frontend and Backend.

## 🚀 Getting Started (For Humans)
1. **Explore the Stats**: Check `/.agent_state/memory_log.md` to see the history of decisions made by the agents.
2. **Review the Specs**: The master engineering contract is located in `/shared/contract.yaml`.
3. **Run a Benchmark**: If you have the Agency CLI installed:
   ```bash
   agency run bench-002
   ```
